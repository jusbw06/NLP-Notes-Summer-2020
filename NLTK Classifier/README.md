# NLTK Classifier Template

Purpose is to provide a template for creating modular document classification tool in Python with interchangeable methods & algorithms.

The goal is for it to be used as a command-line tool where the programmer can switch between ML document comparison & classification tools via command line arguments to ease the of the system use and assist in development of alternative methods and algorithms

*Note*: The project has move to a new route to prioritize using NLP/ML transformer based models. This template has not been updated to reflect the changes.

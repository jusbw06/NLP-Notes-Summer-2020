# Notes -- Justin Wheeler

This repository comprises the majority of my work for summer 2020 at NAVSEA Norco, CA. This delves mostly into studies involving natural language processing and the methods that I have found to be useful for achieving certain tasks.

The most important folders for those who are here are going to be:  

- **NER**: for named entity recognition instructions plus a TF implementation
- **TF Document Classification**: for TF implementation of document classification
- **MS Dataset**: for tools related to checking for document adherence to certain textual and formatting guidelines.

For information on the **Automated Document Classification Project**, please read `ADC writeup.md`

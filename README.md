# Summer 2020 NLP Notes
### Justin Wheeler

This repository comprises the majority of my work during the summer of 2020 at NAVSEA Norco, CA. This delves mostly into studies involving natural language processing and the methods that I have found to be useful for achieving certain tasks.

The most important folders for those who are here are going to be:  

- **Named Entity Recognition**: for named entity recognition instructions and a TF implementation.
- **Document Classification using TensorFlow**: for a TF implementation of a document classifier.
- **Document Adherence to Guidelines (MS Dataset)**: for tools useful for checking document adherence to certain textual and formatting guidelines.

For information on the **Automated Document Classification Project**, please read `Automated Document Classification summary.md`
